# CareConnect: Revolutionizing Personal Support Worker Connections

![CareConnect Logo](image/logo/careConnect.jpeg)

## üí° Inspiration

The healthcare sector faces a significant challenge: efficiently connecting qualified personal support workers (PSWs) with individuals requiring care. Our team members witnessed firsthand how family members struggled to find reliable care providers, often relying on outdated agencies or word-of-mouth referrals. CareConnect was born from this frustration - a modern platform that seamlessly connects care providers with those who need support, developed specifically for cuHacking 2025.

## üîç What it does

CareConnect is a comprehensive web platform with an intuitive, user-friendly interface that:

- **For Clients**: Allows individuals or families to create profiles detailing their specific care needs, browse qualified PSWs in their area, and schedule care services with just a few clicks
- **For PSWs**: Provides a professional platform to showcase skills and specializations, find suitable clients, and manage scheduling efficiently

Key features include:
- Streamlined, intuitive onboarding flow with specialized paths for clients and care providers
- Smart location-based matching system to connect local PSWs with nearby clients
- Simple verification process for PSW credentials
- User-friendly communication channels for direct connection
- Hassle-free schedule coordination and management
- Rating and review system

## ‚öôÔ∏è How we built it

CareConnect is built using a modern tech stack:

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with CSS variables for consistent theming
- **Authentication**: Integration with Auth0 for secure user management
- **Icons/UI**: Font Awesome and custom components
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach ensuring usability across all devices

## üõë Challenges we ran into

During our 36-hour hackathon journey, we faced several challenges:

1. **User Flow Complexity**: Creating intuitive yet comprehensive onboarding flows for two distinct user types
2. **Authentication Integration**: Implementing secure OAuth flows with proper role management
3. **Geocoding Implementation**: Adding location-based services while respecting privacy
4. **Data Validation**: Ensuring robust validation across multi-step forms while maintaining a smooth user experience

## üèÜ Accomplishments that we're proud of

1. Creating a fully functional prototype in just 24 hours
2. Implementing a responsive design that works seamlessly on mobile and desktop
3. Building an intuitive multi-step registration process
4. Successfully integrating authentication with distinct user roles
5. Conducting user testing with actual PSWs and potential clients

## üìö What we learned

- The importance of user research in healthcare tech solutions
- Techniques for building accessible forms for diverse users
- How to effectively manage state across multi-step processes
- Strategies for handling different user roles within a single application
- The complexities of healthcare matching systems

## üöÄ What's next for CareConnect

We're excited about the future of CareConnect and plan to:

1. Implement a verification system for PSW credentials
2. Add real-time messaging between clients and PSWs
3. Develop a mobile app for on-the-go coordination
4. Build an AI matching system to suggest optimal client-PSW pairings
